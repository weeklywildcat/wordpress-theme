# Accessibility Testing Notes

Use this checklist before merging theme layout changes.

## Keyboard checks

- WordPress core's block-theme skip link appears when tabbing into the page.
- The skip link moves focus to the main content area.
- Navigation, search, buttons, and article links can be reached by keyboard.
- Focus order follows the visible page order.
- Focus indicators are visible against the page background.

## Template checks

- Each template has one main content area with `id="content"`.
- Search forms have labels, not only placeholder text.
- Link text explains the destination.
- Headings follow the page structure and are not used only for visual styling.

## Visual checks

- Text remains readable on mobile.
- Color is not the only way to identify links or important information.
- The high contrast style variation still has visible borders, links, and focus outlines.
